What are the key benefits of React JS that encouraged so many businesses and popular brands to use it?
1. Speed ⚡
React basically allows developers to utilize individual parts of their application on both the client-side and the server-side, which ultimately boosts the speed of the development process.
2. Flexibility 💪
Compared to other frontend frameworks, the React code is easier to maintain and is flexible due to its modular structure.
3. Performance 🏗️
React JS was designed to provide high performance in mind. The core of the framework offers a virtual DOM program and server-side rendering, which makes complex apps run extremely fast.
4. Usability 🔧
Deploying React is fairly easy to accomplish if you have some basic knowledge of JavaScript.
5. Reusable Components ♻️
One of the main benefits of using React JS is its potential to reuse components. It saves time for developers as they don’t have to write various codes for the same features.
6. Mobile app development 📱
If you thought React is for web development only, you could not be more wrong! Facebook has already upgraded the framework for developing mobile native applications for both Android & iOS platforms.
